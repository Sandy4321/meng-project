%
%  IIS Poster Style to create Latex A0 Posters
%  ===========================================
%  Peter Luethi, 2006/05/09, Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland
%  last update: 2007/10/14
%
%  Important Notes
%  ---------------
%  The default 'Beamer-Poster' document is top-aligned (documentclass[t]{beamer}).
%  Default font size of beamer class is 11pt. Within this document a font size
%  of 12pt is appropriate for dense posters.
%  If you have less content, consider using 14pt, 17pt, 20pt...
%
%  Bugs / Precautions
%  ------------------
%  Within the poster content, prevent the use of top-aligned multi-columns
%  (top-alignment is done centrally at the main file with documentclass[t]):
%  Don't use \begin{column}[t], instead specify nothing or [c] (centered).
%  Otherwise, Latex (i.e. the beamer class) messes up with the vertical
%  alignement in the poster (frame)...
